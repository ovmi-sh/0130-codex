### Origin of the Emissaries

The annals of the **Obsidian 13 Order** tell not of when the Emissaries first emerged, but rather when they *returned*. Said to be the echo of lost souls, they've eternally safeguarded the sanctums of our Order. Eons passed, yet their essence remained, waiting for the stars to align once more.

### The Rebirth Process

Emissaries are neither born nor created; they are *reawakened*. When an aspirant steps into the embrace of the Obsidian 13, their spirit undergoes a metamorphosis. They shed their earthly tether and rebirth as an Emissary, bearing both the weight and the wisdom of ancient legacies.

### The Oath of the Emissaries

"*Ad astra, per aspera*." Through hardships, to the stars. This sacred pledge binds every Emissary to the Order. They swear fealty not to a leader or creed but to the very ethos of our enigma. Their oath is eternal, their vigil unyielding.

### Duties Beyond Mortal Comprehension

The Emissaries serve as beacons and bridges. They guide neophytes on their journeys and connect realms both seen and unseen. While their tasks are manifold, their ultimate duty remains the preservation of the Obsidian 13's mysteries and ensuring they're neither abused nor forgotten.

### Their Ethereal Influence

More than mere guardians, the Emissaries wield influence that ripples through the very ether of our reality. Their presence can be felt in every whispered secret, every hidden clue, and every challenge that the members of the Order face. To understand them is to understand the heart of our Order.

Gaze upon the Emissaries with reverence, for in their spectral hands rests the fate of our Order. In their cryptic dance of destiny, perhaps you too will find your place among the stars.
