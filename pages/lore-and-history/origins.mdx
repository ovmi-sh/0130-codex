# Origins of the Obsidian 13 Order

In the dim recesses of history, long before our modern world began to take shape, a confluence of events brought together a group of thinkers, warriors, and scholars. These were individuals unsatisfied with the superficial answers the world offered. They yearned for deeper truths, for the hidden layers beneath the obvious. This yearning became the cornerstone of what we now know as the Obsidian 13 Order.

The precise date of the Order's inception is a matter of debate among our scholars. Some ancient parchments suggest it was founded under a lunar eclipse, a rare celestial event where the moon, our emblem of mystery and discovery, took on a shadowed hue, symbolic of the obscured knowledge the Order sought. The number 13, often regarded with superstition, was reclaimed by our founders as a symbol of the unknown and the challenges that lay ahead.

The first gathering took place in an obsidian chamber, deep within a secluded cavern, hidden from the world's prying eyes. This chamber, with walls reflecting the dim torchlight in a myriad of patterns, became the Order's first council room. The choice of obsidian was deliberate. A volcanic glass, obsidian is formed under intense pressure and heat, much like the crucible of curiosity and determination that birthed the Order.

The initial members hailed from diverse walks of life. There were scholars well-versed in ancient texts, warriors who had seen the ends of the world, and thinkers who could discern patterns where others saw chaos. United by a shared mission, they laid down the Order's primary objectives: to seek out the world's most arcane mysteries, to preserve and protect them, and, when deemed right, to share them with those worthy.

The early days were marked by explorations into forgotten realms, deciphering ancient scripts, and understanding esoteric rituals. Over time, as their repository of knowledge grew, so did their influence. But with influence came threats, and thus, the need for secrecy intensified. The Order developed its own code language, rituals, and symbols to keep its knowledge safe.

Today, the Obsidian 13 Order stands as a testament to that unyielding spirit of our founders. A spirit that dared to question, to seek, and to challenge the boundaries of understanding. As members, we are not just inheritors of their legacy but also its guardians, ensuring that the flame of inquiry they ignited continues to light our path.
